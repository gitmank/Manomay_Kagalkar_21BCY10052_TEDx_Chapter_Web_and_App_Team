# TEDx Website for VITB
### TEDx Chapter Recruitment Task for Round 2
### [Here's a video of my process](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1F0Y3C8b8zADsPTyRbftr7MkJYN0s4G8j?usp=sharing)
> video was greater than 25MB, so I'll add a drive link here and a compressed version in the repo

+ > project will work as expected on Chrome or Safari, but I can't vouch for browsers like Opera

## making changes to content
+ head to [```tedxvitbhopal/src/constants.js```](https://github.com/gitmank/Manomay_Kagalkar_21BCY10052_TEDx_Chapter_Web_and_App_Team/blob/b446bd66575f2e86d305833cc481f28736c268d0/tedxvitbhopal/src/constants.js)
